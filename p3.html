      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <h3>Scence 1</h3>
      <p>It is now 1881 and the cast of a new production, Hannibal, are rehearsing onstage.But Carlotta, the Opéra's resident soprano prima donna,  quitting the show. Madame Giry, the Opéra's ballet mistress, informs Firmin and André that Christine Daaé can sing Carlotta's role.  As Christine sings the aria during the evening performance, the Opéra's new patron, Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, recognises her as his childhood friend and playmate.</p>

      <h3>Scence 2</h3>

      <p>The Phantom obliges by appearing as a ghostly, partially masked face in her mirror ("The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)"). Believing him to be the Angel of Music sent by her deceased father, Christine is irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her down into the cellars of the Opéra house.  The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her.

      <h3>Scence 3</h3>
     
      <p>In the managers' office, André and Firman read notes from the Phantom and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again. Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta as the Countess in the new opera, Il Muto, and that Box 5 be kept empty for him.</p>


      <h3> Scence 4</h3>
      <p>The première of Il Muto initially goes well, until the voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance. In the ensuing chaos, Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof and tells him about her subterranean encounter with the Phantom. Raoul is skeptical but promises to love and protect her, and Christine reciprocates his vow ("All I Ask of You").</p>
